# AQ3D Discord Rich Presence
This little Python app only uses data for Discord to display. The backend for this won't ever be released.

# The Idea
The idea behind this was to add some sort of Discord RP for AQ3D, so while you play, others could see a little bit about your session through Discord. The app was designed to use images uploaded to Discord assets to use depending on where you are in the game, and so the image would change.
